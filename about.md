Currently, leading engineering @1upHealth. While studying computer science at University of Vermont, I was involved in a research to improve discharge process and reduce cost of hosplitals by using mobile apps that utilized health care records. Having being worked at a finTech startup and using tools to connect to several banks within minutes using an API with consistent data, I saw the need of the similar mechanism in healthcare and joined 1upHealth as their 2nd Engineer. Besides work, I am is constantly involved with developer community, healthTech events, and hackathons. Recently I recently helped organize Boston Blockchain Week, mentor at MIT hacking medicine, and won ETHBoston at Harvard University among 400+ developer where I used 1upHealth API, Ethereum, and privacy preserving technology to speed up miracles in health care and helping patient participate in data sharing economy.
